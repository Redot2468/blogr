      <h3>Free, open, simple</h3>
      <p>
        Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a large community
        of helpful developers. It supports features such as code syntax
        highlighting, RSS feeds, social media integration, third-party
        commenting tools, and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The
        architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.
      </p>

      <h3>Powerful tooling</h3>
      <p>
        Batteries included. We built a simple and straightforward CLI tool that
        makes customization and deployment a breeze, but capable of producing
        even the most complicated sites.
