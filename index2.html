          <h3> Free, open, simple</h3>
          <p>
            Blogr is a free and open source application backed by a large community of helpful developers. It supports 
            features such as code syntax highlighting, RSS feeds, social media integration, third-party commenting tools, 
            and works seamlessly with Google Analytics. The architecture is clean and is relatively easy to learn.
          
          </p>
  
          <h3>Powerful tooling</h3>
          <p>
            Batteries included. We built a simple and straightforward CLI tool that makes customization and deployment a breeze, but
  capable of producing even the most complicated sites.
